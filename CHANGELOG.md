# Github Invaders Changelog

#### [0.1.4] - 15.06.2024
- Workflow runs but the file doesn't seem to have changed. Added simple-git package & committed & pushed file from the index.js script.

#### [0.1.3] - 15.06.2024
- Committed dependencies to repo. This is usually a terrible idea, but is a necessary evil here to make working with actions easier. Maybe I'll do a docker setup at some point.

#### [0.1.2] - 15.06.2024
- `action.yml` still can't be found. Moved it to root.
- Added github username & token as inputs

#### [0.1.1] - 15.06.2024
- Moved index.js into src folder & specified that in test.yml
- Fixed incorrect action file naming. Apparently it can't be anything but `action.yml`

### [0.1.0] - 15.06.2024
- Basic node project setup
- Changelog & Readme
- Basic `index.js` & `.github/action/text_writing_test/test.yml` action setup. Untested & highly theoretical.
